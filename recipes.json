I prefer to leave the bread uncut during this process so the inside stays soft, but hey, if you like it crispy then by all means, crisp the inside too.\n2) While the bread is toasting, prepare the lettuce leaves by rinsing and drying them.  Cut the avocado in half, remove the seed, and cut slices in each half long-ways before scooping out with a spoon.\n3) When the bread is done, cut it sandwich style and drizzle the inside with the olive oil, then sprinkle the salt and pepper on each half.  The oil will help it stick.  Take a normal spoonful of pesto and spread it on each half of the bread.  Next, do the same with the mayo.   I prefer the mayo amount to be less than the pesto.Arrange the avocado slices on the bottom half of bread, considering the tendency of avocado to slip out when you bite into it.  This is ultimately why I like to keep the inside of the bread soft, because it provides a cushion for biting pressure and thus, less slippage.  Lay the lettuce on the avocado, then put on the top half of the bread and give it a light press to push the avocado down a bit.

Layer on a few slices of avocado on each slice of bread, enough to cover the bottom of the vegan bread.  Put 2 or 3 slices of tomato on top of the avocado, and a few rings of the red onion on the very top.  I like onion so I usually use like 4 rings on each slice of vegan bread, but you can use more or less to taste.\nNext, drizzle on half the olive oil sauce on one slice of vegan bread, and half on the other.  You might want to use a spoon for this part so you don't get too much olive oil sauce in one spot.\nPlace in center oven rack and bake for 12-15 minutes.

Its the perfect party\/finger food, or it also makes a nice entree served alongside brown rice and steamed mustard greens.  Enjoy, and let me know what you think!\nSpicy Mustard dip:\nIn a saucepan, combine the mustard, vegan sugar, and salt.  Add the vinegar and dissolved arrowroot, blending well (its very important that you dissolve the arrowroot in the water *before* adding it.  Otherwise, the mixture will get lumpy).  Cook 2-3 minutes on low, stirring constantly with a whisk or fork, until the mixture thickens.  Remove to a small mixing bowl, and refrigerate 10-15 minutes, then stir in vegan mayonnaise, mixing thoroughly with a whisk or fork.  Store in refrigerator.  Should keep for several days, if not longer.  Note: you can use less mayo or more mustard if you like the sauce spicier.\nSesame Seitan:\nSlice the seitan into narrow strips or fingers.  The thinner and smaller the pieces, the crispier they will get, but I haven't had a problem burning or undercooking them, so you don't need to worry too much about precision here.  Combine the flour and sesame seeds (which you can toast lightly, if you like) in a shallow bowl, and dredge the seitan until coated.  I find that packaged seitan holds the coating well without additional liquid, but if its not sticking, you can dredge the seitan in a little plain soymilk first, and then coat it in the flour mixture.\nMeanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan.  Depending on the depth of your pan, you might need more or less oil; the important thing is that the seitan can be submerged so that all sides brown evenly.  When the oil is super hot, carefully place a few of the coated strips at a time in the oil and fry until golden brown (about 5-7 minutes).  (To test the oil for hotness, I usually just drop in a teeny broken off piece of the coated seitan and see what happens.  The oil should bubble up all around it, but it won't splatter if you use pure oil and a clean pan.)  Again, fry to your own taste, but I find that the longer you leave the strips in, the crispier they get.  Remove the fried strips from the oil with a metal spatula or slotted metal spoon, and place on paper towels to absorb the extra oil.  (You can blot gently, as well.)  Repeat until all the seitan is fried.  Serve with the mustard dip.  You can eat the strips hot, or you can let them cool to room temperature; I think they taste great cold, too!\nI have no clue what the nutritional info on this is, but I think of it as a protein dish.  If you're worried about fat intake, don't be too afraid of the deep-frying; they say food actually absorbs less oil this way than sauteed!","150":"Put everything in the blender, blend until smooth, and enjoy!\nSource of recipe: I came up with this.","151":"1.

It's best if you allow to marinate overnight. Preheat grill.\n3. After the tofu has marinated, grill it up! Make sure to either oil the grill so the tofu doesn't stick or place tofu on a piece of foil while grilling. Grill each side about 7 minutes. The tofu should have nice grill marks on it.\n4. Steam the broccoli to desired doneness. To make the rice, bring coconut milk to a boil. Be careful, as once the coconut milk begins to boil, it can boil over your pot!\n5. Once boiling, turn down the heat and add basmati rice. Bring rice back to a boil, cover and let simmer for about 40 minutes. Serve the tofu with the coconut rice and steamed broccoli.\nDelicious!

Nothing is worse than biting into a wonton and hitting a huge patch of ginger. Put wrappers and bowl on counter.\n3. Put a frying pan on low heat with about 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in it. While pan is heating, fill 3-4 wontons with about 1 tablespoon filling.\n4. Fold, sealing the last corner with egg replacer. Make only 3-4 at a time, so they don't get soggy.

Drizzle about a tablespoon of the balsamic vinegar mixture onto the plated zucchini. Garnish by sprinkling some sesame seeds, scallions, and remaining pepper on each plated appetizer.\nServe and listen for the \"ooohs\" and ahhhs\"! This is a very elegant looking plated appetizer.

Make a vegan egg by mixing the cornstarch and water. Use a brush to wet the edges of the wontons with the vegan egg mix, and place about 1 to 1 1\/2 teaspoons tofu in the center of each wonton.\n3. Fold into a triangle ensuring that the edges are sealed (also avoid air pockets). Then take one wet corner and fold it over the other to create desired shape. Again ensure the corners are sealed against each other.\n4. Pan sear the wontons in the oil at medium heat for about 1 minute on each side. If the oil is too hot, the wontons will burn and, if it is too low, they will be greasy.

After 30 minutes, uncover the bulgur and give it a few good stirs and fluff it up with a fork. The grain should have soaked up all of the hot water. If there's remaining water, drain it through a strainer.\n3. Stir in the tomato, cucumber, parsley, and mint. In a separate bowl, combine the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.\n4. Mix well, then pour this dressing over the salad. Give the whole thing a good stir. Refrigerate for a few hours, tossing occasionally to distribute the dressing.\nIt's ready to eat right away, but the flavors really start to meld together if you let it sit for a while. This recipe made an enormous amount of tabbouleh, although between 4 of us, it was all gone in less than 2 days. It keeps pretty well in the fridge for up to a week (though ours never lasts that long), so you may want to cut the recipe in 1\/2 if you're cooking for 1-2.\nTraditional tabbouleh usually doesn't call for cucumber, but I like to add it to mine. This tabbouleh is also more bulgur heavy than a lot of tabbouleh you might find in stores, so it makes a meal in itself, instead of more of a side salad.

Pour oil into large pot until it's about an inch deep. A saucepan might work, but definitely don't use a shallow pan.  Put the heat at medium-low and clip an oil thermometer on the side of the pan so the tip is in the oil, but not touching the bottom. If you need, add more oil.\n2. Heat to 365 degrees F. (shimmering and swirly). If it smokes, it's way too hot, you've ruined the molecular structure of the oil and have to start all over, so start low. To chop the pumpkin, you want to end up with pieces that are 1\/2\" thin. I suggest peeling it and slicing into strips like melon wedges, then cutting into squares, triangles, etc, and then slicing those in 1\/2.\n3. When finished, toss the pumpkin with the lemon juice and set aside to get juicy. For the beer batter, mix all the dry ingredients together, then drizzle the beer on top. The texture should be thicker than pancake batter, and can be a little clumpy. You can test the oil by dropping a small bit of batter in and see if it sinks and then rises while bubbly.\n4. Drop 4-5 at a time in the batter, swish them around until they're thickly coated, then gently place them in the oil. If it splatters like crazy, your oil's too hot, turn it down and wait; don't add more frumpkins for a few minutes. Keep an eye on the little frumpkins because they like to hang out in the same corner and end up stuck together.\n5. When they're a crunchy golden brown, fish them out with the basket or tongs, and place on paper towels on a plate. Cut the first one in 1\/2 and taste to see if you need to adjust cooking time. I've deduced that pieces about 2\" square take roughly 4 minutes to cook give or take a few. Keep in mind that the frumpkins decrease the temperature of the oil, so you'll want to wait a minute between rounds to let it heat up again.\nNow, whether you serve them hot as a breakfast, a dessert, or a freakishly tasty appetizer with toothpicks, you need a dipping sauce. I have not tried the following suggestions: molasses, thickened coconut milk, tamarind sauce, marmalade, applesauce, lemon juice and nut butter, perhaps a tasting bar is in order. Let me know your thoughts if you try this.\nIf you actually have leftovers, I suggest warming them up the next day under a broiler or in a toaster oven, but they're not so great, so I suggest eating them all and having no leftovers.

Arrange attractively on a serving plate and divide yogurt between 4 small dipping bowls (1 for each person).\n5. Garnish with a drizzle of sauce and a sprig of mint.\nThis is a great recipe for a midsummer brunch. It should be served with something light on the side, as these aren't very substantial on their own. It can, however, be changed to suit anyones tastes and sweet-tooth. Great with any fruit you would like.  Great ones to try: peaches, pineapple, coconut shreds, small apple chunks, chopped cherries, mandarin orange segments (patted dry first), mango, papaya, pear.\nA great sauce to try drizzled on bananas inside the roll: vegan chocolate melted with a bit of peanut butter; it's very easy to make these look elegant and taste delicious!

When they are done, remove from heat and pour off excess water.\n3. Meanwhile, in a large pan, saute the onions in olive oil with a little salt for about 5 minutes, then add the carrots. Continue to saute until the onions are soft and sweet. Add the garlic and saute for a couple more minutes, don't let the garlic burn.\n4. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, spices, crushed green peppercorns and salt to the mix, heat through and adjust spices to taste. When the eggplant is done, carefully scoop out the flesh, leaving the shell at least 1\/2\" thick. Finely chop the flesh, and add it, the lentils and the parsley to the tomato sauce.\n5. Mix it all together, taste for final seasoning, and fill the eggplant shells. (I usually have some stuffing left over, and have it with toast for lunch the next day).

In a pan, heat up some of your vegan buttery spread and then place the chunks in the pan.

Saute until it begins to look and smell like it's almost finished, usually about 6 minutes or less, depending on your stove.\nYou'll want to have your soy sauce, chili oil and lemon juice mixed together in a measuring cup or small bowl.

Stir onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cauliflower pieces and stir with onion, add another pinch of salt. (My husband had a fit when he saw me adding salt after several vegetables in this dish. I know it seems like a lot of salt when we have been brainwashe'd in to believing salt is bad for us. Use common sense and your taste buds as a guide - if you do not eat a lot of processed foods, fast foods, or have high blood pressure or other health condition that is aggravated by salt, adding a pinch of salt after each vegetable is not excessive. I just completed a nutrition course in which this topic was discussed extensively and it was emphasized that the salt added to cooking is typically not a culprit to unhealthy salt consumption - its the canned, processed foods and the drive through windows that are killing us!)\nOk, back to cooking. Turn the heat down to medium, cover the cauliflower and let it cook for 3-5 minutes so it softens. Uncover and add another tablespoon of olive oil if needed (may or may not need to use all 4 tablespoons - its to keep the veggies coated and from sticking to the pan).

Drain spaghetti in colander and as it drains, add the soy sauce to the wok and continue to stir. Once the peanut butter and soy sauce (trust me) are mixed in real good, add the pasta and keep on stirring. Get it all mixed together real well and taste it.

Slice and serve with some good homemade Italian bread and a vegan Caesar salad. Awesome! This is good with mushrooms, too. I think some sliced olives would also go well here! The typical non-vegan lasagna has that browned cheese look, and this one is just mostly red. Don't let that fool you though, it's delicious! The layers look nice.\nI served it to my omnivore brother, mother, and dad, and they had seconds and thirds. My brother said that it tasted like, \"real\" lasagna, not like it was just trying to be lasagna. I think that has a lot to do with the tofu-ricotta and the sprinkling of Daiya! I think adding some tempeh sausage crumbles to this would be very good too, for something different!\nI hope this turns out as well for you as it did for me! It's kind of labor intensive, but if you have the time, it just might be the best lasagna you've ever had! It was for me!

Note: The sauce will thicken more as you do the next step.\nIn a skillet, saute the diced mushroom in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil until soft, add to soup mixture along with your parsley. Then, saute onions and garlic in the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, till onions are clear. Add and heat ground crumbles with onion mixture. In lightly sprayed\/oiled 9 x 9 casserole dish, layer with the crumbles, then frozen vegetables, then the mushroom soup, top with tater tots. I also added some homemade vegan cheese sauce on top of the tater tots and sprinkled with 1\/2 cup french fried onions. Bake uncovered for about 45-60 mins.

H20 (I think brown\/green lentils need more water).\n2.  Cook textured soy protein in about 1.5-2 c. H2O.\n3.  Begin to saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic in water or olive oil.  When they begin to look a bit translucent\/browned, respectively, throw in the carrots.\n4.  In the meantime, throw the lentils, textured soy protein, and beans in a large, unbreakable pot.  Mash them up well.\n5.  Just as the vegetables are beginning to look done, throw in the corn and peas and cook just enough to heat them through.  (note:  the vegetables are better if they're a bit on the raw side.  Vegetables are ALWAYS better a bit on the raw side!)\n6.  Add the vegetables to the pot along with your favorite seasonings and the flour.  Mix well (gently!).  The mixture should be moist, but hold together fairly well.\n7.  Take a large handful of the mix.  Roll it into a ball in the palms of your hands.  Flatten the ball on a dinner plate and smooth the edges so the patty looks pretty, like the store-bought veggie burgers.\n8.  Pan fry the patties over medium heat in a non-stick pan sprayed with that spray-no-fat oil stuff.  Each side needs about 2-4 minutes.  When they are nicely browned, they are done.\nServing suggestions:  I like mine on toasted whole wheat vegan bread with lettuce and ketchup.  My faithful sidekick, for whom these burgers are named (after the first enormous bite, he said, These are burgers with which to reckon!), goes all the way:  toasted pita, lettuce, sprouts, tomato, horseradish, mustard.

Place half of the veggies in the blender, adding just enough water or broth into mix to puree veggies.\nLightly grease a baking dish, set oven to 350 degrees.  Put vegetable puree in  dish and bake for fifteen minutes.  Use as a \"crust\" for your favorite dishes.  For example, I added black eyed peas, fennel seed, thyme and tarragon to the top of the crust and baked it for another 10 minutes.  It made a lovely side dish.\nYou can also use the second half of the veggies as the \"top crust\", pureed or not.  I see this puree as being very versatile--just think--\"cream\" soups, casseroles, wet ingredients in baking, folded into polenta, veggie bread pudding entree, etc., etc.  I'm so glad that I didn't put all of those good vegetables to waste!

Stop adding liquid when the crust is just barely holding together (still crumbly, but you could make it stick together if you tried to ball it up).\n3.

For crust, in a large bowl, combine flour and salt; mix thoroughly. With fingers, forks or a pastry cutter, work quickly to cut vegetable shortening into the flour\/salt mixture. If using hands, pinch shortening into flour. Resulting mixture will have fat chunks the size of a pea.  Spoon in chilled water 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing gently with a fork after each addition. Use only as much water as you need to gently form the dough into a ball. Handle the dough as little as possible to avoid creaming the lumps of fat into the flour. There should be small balls of fat throughout the dough as this encourages a flaky crust. Overworking the dough will make it tough and dense.\n2. Split the dough into 2 equal amounts. Pat them into balls and wrap them in plastic wrap. Allow dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Dough can be made a day ahead. To roll out dough, remove 1 ball dough from the refrigerator and place on a well floured surface. Sprinkle a little flour on the ball and flatten gently with hands. Using a lightly dusted rolling pin, begin rolling at the center of the dough and work outwards. For easier clean up you can roll out the dough between sheets of waxed paper. Working quickly, roll the dough into a circle 1\/4\" thick or smaller. Be sure to make dough a few inches larger than your pie pan or dish.\n3. Gently fold the dough in half, and then into quarters and carefully place it into a lightly oiled pie plate so the center of dough is in the center of the pan. Carefully unfold the dough and press into the pan. Trim any excess dough and feel free to pinch the edges to make a fancy edge around the crust. Cover gently with waxed paper and place in refrigerator while you prepare your filling.\n4. For filling, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a food processor, add chunks of the tofu, 2 garlic cloves, nutritional yeast, onion powder, turmeric, salt, black salt, and pepper. Stream in the oil and process until smooth. Remove mixture from processor and pour into bowl using a spatula or scraper to get every last bit. Add in oregano, thyme, and parsley. Meanwhile bring a large pot of salted water to boil and add in the asparagus. Cook for 1 minute, remove from hot water and place into a bowl of ice water to halt the cooking process. Remove from ice water, lightly pat dry and set aside.\n5. In a large saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil and saute the leeks and the clove of minced garlic for about 6 minutes. Add the chopped mushrooms and continue cooking until soft. Remove from heat and set aside. Remove chilled pie crust from refrigerator. With a fork, make a few holes in the bottom of the crust to allow steam to escape. Place a sheet of waxed or parchment paper on the crust and add pie weights, dry beans or dry rice to help blind bake the dough. This keeps the dough from getting soggy from the filling and prevents air bubbles from forming. Bake for 10 minutes.\n6. While the crust is blind baking add the leeks, mushrooms, asparagus, and cheese to the tofu mixture and mix to combine. Reserve a few asparagus tips as a decorative topping for the quiche. Pour mixture into your pre-baked pie pan, arrange asparagus in whatever shape you fancy (I like stars) and bake for 45 minutes, or until crust is golden and tofu is firm. Allow 10 minutes to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nThe second ball of dough is just extra dough which can be used to make another quiche, if you'd like, or whatever you fancy.

Continue mixing with hands until mixture appears crumbly.\n2. Gradually pour in the iced water and vinegar mixture and begin working everything together until a dough forms. Mixture should be moist and pliable. If it's a little dry, add water a few tablespoons at a time until the right consistency is reached.\n3. Form dough into a ball and allow to rest inside the refrigerator for about 15 minutes. Lightly grease a baking sheet. Take a portion of the dough and roll out to about 1\/8\" thickness. The thinner you go the more crisp your cracker will be. Try to roll the dough out to this thickness all around.\n4. Using a small cookie cutter of your choice, begin cutting out your shapes.  I used a small paring knife and a chop stick to carve in the little details on each individual cracker.  Place your crackers on prepared baking sheet, spray the tops of the crackers with olive or canola oil spray and sprinkle with fine sea salt.\n5. Continue the rolling and cutting process until you run out of dough. Any remaining dough scraps should be refrigerated and allowed to rest before re-rolling. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the bottoms are a light golden brown. Slide crackers on a parchment paper lined cooling rack. Once cooled, store in an air tight container at room temperature.\nThese should keep for about a week or so, but I doubt they'll last that long.\nTips:\nSave yourself time and get some mini-cookie cutters. The first time I made these I hand carved squares to make my own cheez-its. It was not fun and the crackers were not as cool looking.\nAllow the scrap dough to chill and rest about 10 minutes before re-rolling and cutting. Also place any ready to bake sheet pans in the fridge while you're working on a different sheet.

Heat over low heat, stir occasionally until well blended, about 10 minutes. Let cool. You don't want to melt the chocolate chips right off when you add it in.\n3) Mix all dries together well. Mix chocolate chips in last. The coating of dry soymilk and bran will help them \"float\" in the mix, rather than sink to the bottom. Mix the cooled peanut butter mix into the dry mix. It should be cooled to about room temperature.\n4) Line a 9x13\" pan or cookie sheet with parchment paper. It really really does make it easier. Press the mixture into the cookie pan.

Much to the surprise of  my linear mind-set, it will work, so long as youend up with a sticky mass of stuff to press into the pan. I'm a remedial algebra teacher, so if I can get it to work, so canyou. Read the ingredient list. I've found a surprising number of chocolate chips are vegan if you read the list carefully. Do it for fun,at the least. I live in a tiny western town  less than 25,000, but can still find vegan chips if I look carefully, even at Safeway. The result is cake or cookie like in texture, not crispy. My non-vegan child calls it a brownie.\nSource of recipe: This is based off several popular granola bar recipes, but is what made myvegan and non-vegan family happy.","694":"Put salt, nutritional yeast and cumin in dry container of your blender and grind until almost powdery.\nHeat oil in a large saucepan or soup pot over medium-high heat.

One serving is 6 chips.","699":"OK. I am admittedly a little uptight about the correct way to make nachos.  The secret, I believe, (and we all know I'm right) is LAYERING. This takes a while, but it's well worth the effort.\n1) Heat frying pan on medium heat with the olive oil. Add the Boca Crumble. Let the crumble get all nice and crispy.\n2)  Add the canned tomatoes and their juice, and the chile powder.  This should get all nice and thick after about 2 minutes. Remove from frying pan onto a plate and set aside to cool.\n3) Drain the canned mushrooms. Chop the green onions fairly thinly. Dice the fresh tomatoes. Put in separate small bowls.\n4) Grate cheese. Put in bowl. Set aside.\n5) Get two bigish microwave safe plates.  Put down a layer of chips on each.  Don't just dump them on, but arrange them so they each get a equal helping of nacho goodness. (I usually have about 20 chips per plate).\n6) Sprinkle 1\/4 of each the green onions, diced tomatoes, Boca \"ground beef\", and mushrooms on each of the plates. (Here, you can add the jalapenos, green or chipotle chilies, or olives, I suppose.  I hate olives - go figure.) Make sure all ingredients are equally spread out on the chips. Sprinkle 1\/4 of the grated cheese on each plate.\n7) Repeat steps 5 and 6, starting by placing a layer of chips on top of the previous layer of cheese.\n8) Heat each plate in microwave until cheese is melted. (With the Vegan Gourmet brand, it takes about 5 minutes for it to be melted like \"real\" cheese.  I will melt it for a minute at a time, just to make sure it doesn't overcook. I find it melts better this way, and is delicious.  It doesn't really melt in the oven.)\n9) Enjoy with guacamole, refried beans and salsa. This makes 2 VERY generous portions. (Hey, vegans can pig out too!)\nThis may seem like a laborious process, but it is worth it in the end. You just can't fool around with nachos :)","7":"Inside:Mix together the dry inside ingredients.  Mix the wet ingredients separately (not including the broth), and then stir together the wet and dry ingredients (not including the broth).

It will come out just as yummy with an unfrozen banana too, but i prefer mine frozen. Add your strawberries, blueberries, chai soy milk and spices. If you don't have pumpkin pie spice, basically all it is is allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger so you can add a little bit of each. I usually just put in a quick shake of cinnamon and a quick shake of pumpkin pie spice. If it's too thick you can add more chai soy so it will blend better. You can also use fresh strawberries and blueberries instead of frozen but you may need to sweeten it a little. It's up to you! And that's it!

The more beverage you add, the more liquidy your smoothie will be.\nThen add chopped up banana and avocado.  Blend until the smoothie is a nice, even green color.  Add the flaxseed and protein powder - blend until the specks seem to be evenly distributed.\nNow is the time to taste - if the smoothie is too liquidy, try adding another 1\/2 or whole banana.  If the smoothie is too bitter, add sweetener to your taste.  If the smoothie is too warm (I always use cold rice milk, so I only sometimes have to add ice), add ice.  Pulverized ice generally makes for a smoother smoothie - since my ice cubes rarely get completely churned.\nPour into a large mug or glass, and enjoy!

I keep 2 flavors of 100% juice concentrate in my fridge just for this purpose: apple-strawberry-kiwi and orange with calcium added.  This could easily be replaced by maple syrup, agave, whatever sweetener you choose.\nSome people don't like flax, but it isn't even noticeable and is a great way to get added nutrition, so I suggest using it.\nThe recipe yields 4 cups.","764":"Smash tofu and put it into blender.  add cocoa powder, sweetener and soymilk and blend altogether.

Add this back into the saucepan of caramel and heat, stirring constantly until mixture thickens (be careful to scrap the bottom of the saucepan cos the mixture tends to stick there). The mixture should be very thick.  If it hasn't thickened enough repeat the procedure with another Tablespoon of cornstarch. Once the caramel is done pour over the base and bake for another 10-12 minutes, until the edges of the caramel are slightly browned. Let the slice cool to room temperature.\nOnce slice has fully cooled, melt the chocolate in your preferred method, taking care not to burn. Pour evenly over the slice and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour. Check the slice every 10 minutes or so and when the chocolate is still soft but cool enough to keep it's shape, run a knife just through the chocolate layer in the sizes that you would like your slices to be (I suggest small squares as it's very rich). This will stop the chocolate layer from cracking when you try to slice it later. After an hour you can cut the slice to your desired size, and store in a tightly sealed container in the fridge.","804":"2 8 oz. containers vegan cream cheese 2 tablespoon soy milk 1 cup natural sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 teaspoon grated lime peel 4 tablespoon lime juice 2 tablespoon cornstarch 1 9inch vegan graham cracker crust sliced strawberries","805":"1.

I honestly have tried a lot of microwave chocolate cake, recipes and I didn't like any of them, so I made my own recipe. I think the trick is to mix different tipes of chocolate, I use cocoa and chocolate powder.","814":"3\/4 cup Sugar","815":"1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan with vegetable shortening.  You can also line the pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil that over hang the sides so that after the brownies have cooled you can simple remove the whole batch from the pan.  Make sure to grease the parchment\/aluminum if you choose this option.\n2. Melt together the shortening, semi sweet chocolate, and the unsweetened chocolate in a medium bowl in the microwave.  Make sure to go 30 seconds at a time and stir in between each heating to make sure you do not burn the chocolate since the chocolate will melt from the inside out.\n3. To prepare the egg replacer, I use a different ratio than is used on the box: For each egg replacer, I whip together 3 teaspoons egg replacer for every 2 tablespoons warm water, so altogether you will use 8 tablespoons of warm water and 12 teaspoons of egg replacer.  Whip until frothy. (Note: If you are using a different binder, this double the binder to the same amount of liquid - normally, it's 1-1\/2 teaspoons EnerG Egg Replacer per 2 tablespoons water.)\n4. Allow the chocolate mixture to cool slightly. In a large bowl, stir (do not beat) together the egg replacer, coffee granules, vanilla, and sugar. Stir the warm chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.\n5. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the cooled chocolate mixture and stir until combined. If you choose to include them, toss the walnuts and chocolate chips in a medium bowl with enough flour to coat, then add them to the chocolate batter. Pour into the baking sheet and spread the brownie dough evenly into the pan.\n6. Bake for 20 minutes, then rap the baking pan against the oven shelf to force the air to escape from between the pan and the brownie dough. Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Do not overbake!

People with oily skin might find this to be a bit much.FYI2: It also makes a nice hair conditioner.\nSource of recipe: Thrifty discovery!

Rub the paste directly onto your scalp.  Rinse.\n2. Then, pour the apple cider vinegar into a cup with about 1\/4 cup water.\n3. Pour this mixture over your hair. You can let this sit for a few minutes. Rinse with water.\nDepending on how long\/short your hair is, you may have to increase\/decrease.  This always leaves my hair soft and very clean, without damaging it with too much cleansing.\nIf your hair gets dry and frizzy, reduce the amount of baking soda.  If it seems oily, increase the amount of baking soda.  You may notice your hair looks\/feels different for the first few days, but your scalp will adjust!\nThis is the best method for washing my hair I've ever found.  I hate the waste associated with all the organic shampoos and conditioners out there.","842":"Mix together 1 part leftover coffee grinds and 1 part liquid soap. Rub into hands or affected area. Rinse off.","843":"Dampen the cloth and add a small amount of baking soda (less than 1 tablespoon should do).\nPlace the article to be cleaned on the cloth and wrap the article in it. Rub gently, moving the article around in the cloth to remove the tarnish.\nWhen the article is clean, rinse well in running water and dry.","844":"Add the Borax and Sal Suds to pail and clean that dirty car!\nUse a scrub brush for the interior, seats, floor, and dashboard. No need to rinse.  Roll down windows and let dry.\nWhen your interior is dry, Roll up widows, and use a sponge to wash the exterior of your car. Rinse off with hose.  Let dry.","845":"First, spill the red wine on the carpet  :)\nOnce you've got the spill, remove as much as you can by dabbing with the towels (do not rub, though!).  This dabbing takes a while, so be patient.\nOnce you've gotten as much out as you can, spill white wine or white vinegar over the spot, let sit a few moments, then begin dabbing again (again, press the towel down on the stain, but do not rub).\nRepeat this step for as long as your towels are still coming up pink and you can still see a stain on the carpet.  This works really well, but you just have to be patient.\nWhen it's 99% gone, you can pour baking soda over the spot and let it dry, and vacuum it up 12-24 hours later.  This will often remove the last lingering shadow of a stain.\nActually, if you spill red wine and are out of white wine or vinegar, you can just pour baking soda on the spot, let the baking soda absorb the wine and dry (which can sometimes take a full day or two), and then vacuum it up when it is dry.  This method works pretty well, too.","846":"1. Bring water to a boil.\n2. Reduce heat and add flax seeds. Simmer for 10 minutes.\n3. Strain into a bottle and put it on your hair!!\nStore in the fridge for up to a week.\nI personally had a lot of trouble straining this, so I read suggestions of putting the seeds in some panty hose and boiling them in that. I just simmered them for 6 minutes, before it turned into a gel and strained them.\nSource of recipe: I found this on another forum and I love it!!","847":"Not only is this rinse much cheaper than the chemical gunk you can buy commercially, but it is easy, effective, far better for your hair, and smells wonderful - there is nothing like using fresh rosemary to give you a lift!\nYou can use either fresh or dried herbs for this.  If you have a rosemary bush handy, use a sprig or two (say 10cm long): rosemary is one of the best herbs for hair.  Fresh lavender is also nice to use; most of the herbs you can grow in your garden will probably be useful in some way or other.  Fresh herbs are wonderful to use, but do remember to rinse them if they have been sprayed with anything, whether rose feed, pesticide, or contributions from a passing dog.\nIf using dried herbs, you can use them either loose or in teabags if they are available as such, e.g. one chamomile teabag.  Loose herbs, provided you have access to these (my local herbalist has a large selection), give you more choice; howe'ver, they can be messy to use.  Use either an infuser ball (I find a few bits always escape, though) or tie a few teaspoonfuls of herb up in a bit of muslin or similar fabric.  You don't want to have bits of herb caught in your hair afterwards!\n1) Put the herbs into a jug and add the vinegar and your essential oil.\n2) Add the boiling water and stir to disperse the essential oils.  Set to one side while you wash your hair: this gives it time to steep, and also for the water to cool a little.  If you want a stronger herbal infusion, you can boil up herbs in a pan on the stove for ten minutes.\n3) When you have finishe'd washing and rinsing your hair, add enough cool water to fill the jug nearly to the top and also to make it a bearable temperature.  If you're feeling brave, go for cold water as it will give your hair added shine.\n4) If you have very long hair, as I do, you can dip your hair into the jug before pouring its contents over your head, rubbing into the scalp and catching any stray bits of herb before they get caught in your hair.  Avoid getting the rinse in your eyes, particularly if you have used essential oils.\n5) Make sure you rinse out the shower afterwards, as some herbs can leave it looking slightly stained; similarly, watch out for your towels.  The staining is only temporary and washes off\/out very easily; it is more likely to occur with extra strong infusions.\nUseful herbs:\nRosemary - excellent for all hair types and problems.  Sage - traditionally used to restore colour to greying hair.  Chamomile - another very useful herb for hair, traditionally used for lighter colour hair.  Thyme - good for oily hair and dandruff.\nUseful essential oils:\nRosemary and chamomile: see above.  I would not advise thyme oil, since it is very strong and a potential skin irritant.  Sage oil should not be used (unless by professionals, but I don't think they use it on hair); clary sage is a good substitute.\nCedarwood: very traditional oil for all hair types and conditions.\nLavender and geranium:  useful for all hair types.\nLemon, patchouli, tea tree, ylang-ylang: useful for greasy hair and dandruff.\nYou can use any essential oil you fancy, provided it is not a skin irritant (I would never suggest using clove oil, for example).  If I am in meditative mood I sometimes use frankincense, for example, or sandalwood (good for dry hair) if I want the lingering smell of sandalwood that day.\nIn general, this rinse keeps your hair in good condition and adds considerable shine, as well as seeming to make it tangle less.  It is also a useful way of treating hair that is not looking its best, for example if it is dry, greasy or prone to dandruff.  I have hair I can sit on, and people are always telling me how beautiful it looks and smells.\nIf you like doing facial saunas or face masks, before you wash your hair is a good time to do so.  Here is what I usually do:\n1) Put the herbs into the jug together with the boiling water, but do not add the vinegar yet.  Put in only 2 drops of essential oil after the water has been added.\n2) Put a towel over your head, tying long hair back, lean over the jug, and inhale the steam for 5-10 minutes.  Be careful not to scald yourself: if the steam is too hot, let it cool for half a minute or so.\n3) Use a little of the infused water to mix up a face mask with clay and anything else you may use.\n4) While the mask is drying on your skin, add the cider vinegar and the rest of the essential oils to the jug.\n5) Wash the face mask off (I find it is easiest to do so in the shower) and proceed as above with the hair rinse.","848":"Take a rag, dip it in vinegar.

The wheatgerm oil is necessary to preserve the life of your blend; if you intend to use it up quickly, then this is not necessary.  You can also purchase ready-blended carrier oil bases, which usually include the correct amount of wheatgerm oil already.\nThis blend was formulated with menstrually-related migraines in mind, since these are the ones I principally suffer from.  As a result, the oils chosen also have hormone-balancing properties as well as being good general analgesics and muscle relaxants.  This oil is also useful for menstrual cramping.\nMigraine tends to affect ones sense of smell and often causes nausea; hence what may be perfect for one person may not be acceptable for another.  This blend has a herby, somewhat heavy aroma that I find is absolutely fine, but if you want something sharper, try:\n5 drops lavender 5 drops rosemary 5 drops grapefruit 30ml carrier oil\nIf your headache is due to having a cold, eucalyptus would be a particularly useful oil to use (instead of grapefruit, say; same quantity).\nIf you feel a migraine descending, rub this oil on your face, neck and shoulders, put some of the essential oils on an oil burner if you have one, drink a glass or two of water (mint tea is also useful), eat something starchy, and a lot of the time this will do the trick (if it doesn't, rest in a darkened room).\nAromatherapy is very successful in treating migraine, where conventional painkillers often aren't.  This is because the essential oils get directly into the bloodstream, either through the capillary network if applied to the skin, or through the lungs if inhaled.  They do not need to pass through the digestive system first, which is just as well since digestion tends to shut down during migraine, which is why painkillers often do not work.\nDrinking gallons of water and eating regularly makes an enormous difference to migraine attacks.  If you suffer from nausea, try eating pickled ginger, the thin pink strips that are used in sushi.  Then go and eat some toast or something dry, whether you feel like it or not: not eating will only worsen both the nausea and the migraine.","861":"Bentonite clay can be found in the beauty isle of the health food store, it's usually used to make masks for facials, but I use it to brush with.

If anyone knows of a more eco-friendly, durable brand of paper towel, PLEASE DO TELL!!!  I would love to know!\nYIELD:  A standard sized roll of Bounty will yield 56 wipes per batch (that's 112 wipes per roll).  If you buy a roll that has the smaller \"customizable\" perforations, you'll get even more wipes (this is the route I usually go).\nLastly, if you end up purchasing the new Super Rolls they have now, you'll need to double the recipe so that your wipes aren't too dry: 1 - 3\/4 to 2 cup water, 2 tablespoon oil, 2 tablespoon wash.","869":"Grate the bar of soap.

It makes two pizzas which is enough for 2 or 3 people (only 3 if you\u2019re going to have side items).  If you\u2019re cooking for just yourself, halving this recipe is very easy.\nMix the flour, sugar, and yeast.  Add the salt and incorporate.  Add water (make sure it is close to room temperature, or it may kill\/retard the yeast).  Mix for about 30-60 seconds, but not too much, as it shouldn't be totally smooth.  If the dough doesn't feel sticky at all, add 1\/2 teaspoons of water and mix very slightly until it does.\nMove the dough into a clean bowl and pour the olive oil over it.  Flip the dough until it is covered in the oil.  Put plastic wrap or a clean towel over the bowl and store it in a warm (not hot) place until it doubles in volume. This will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour 15.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees.\nHalve the bell pepper and remove the seeds and core.  Chop each half into three or four strips longwise and then in inch-long pieces from there.  Halve the zucchini and squash longwise and chop in inch-long pieces as well.  Arrange veggies in a baking dish and drizzle with olive oil.  Add salt and herbs to taste (don't worry about adding too much herbs, they are super tasty).  Toss and place in oven.  Bake 10-15 minutes and then flip, then bake another 8-12 minutes until tender and brown on the edges.\nAfter the dough has risen, using a sharp knife or dough scraper, cut it in half and work each piece lightly in your hands, shaping the dough into a flattened ball.  Place each on a separate pizza dish or sheet pan, drizzle remaining olive oil over both and cover with plastic wrap for 5 minutes.\nLeave the plastic wrap on and press gently from the inside out to form a pizza crust.  If the dough doesn't work well, put it in a warm-hot place (above the oven works well) for about 5 minutes.  When the dough has been shaped (depending on how much the dough rose, each pizza should be about 9 - 11 inches), leave it in a warm place covered for 20 minutes or so (This time can be drastically reduced by placing it in a warmer spot).  Raise the oven temperature to 475 degrees.\nIn the meantime, dice the onions and mince the garlic.  Sautee both in oil over medium heat, until soft, then add chopped spinach stir until the leaves wilt.  Remove from heat.\nRemove the plastic wrap from the pizza crusts and bake for five minutes (note that you can bake them one at a time if your oven is small like mine).  Spread some of the jarred pasta sauce (or you can used canned plain tomato sauce) over the crusts and spread for a thin layer.  Divide onion mixture in two and spread across pizza, and repeat with the roasted veggies.  Chop the artichoke hearts and place over the layers.  Bake the pizzas for 5 more minutes or until the crust is a dark golden brown.  Slice and serve.\nIf you want to speed up the process, when you let the dough rise put it in a warmer place.  The crust won\u2019t have quite as much flavor, but it still beats Papa Johns any day.  Also, you can obviously customize what veggies you use, I just think this combination is great.  Be sure to roast any larger, firmer vegetables to make them taste that much better on the pizza.","873":"Depending on the size of your tortilla, you may need more or less of the ingredients listed.

Mix all wet \"crust\" ingredients together in a separate bowl.  Stir wet ingredients into dry and mix thoroughly.  Form the dough into a big ball.  You will probably need to add water to achieve this.\nRoll the dough ball out into a circle and transfer carefully onto the prepared pizza pan.  Bake for 8 or more minutes, until done (a very light golden brown).  Cool crust.\nMeanwhile, slice the apples very thinly and place in the lemon lime soda (this keeps them from browning).  Peels can, and should, be left on for nutrition and visual appeal.\nPrepare the remaining topping by beating together faux cream cheese, peanut butter, brown sugar and milk until smooth.\nIf preparing caramel sauce, add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to 1\/2 cup soy milk.  Set this aside and combine 1\/2 cup sugar (white works best) with 1 tablespoon water in a non-stick saucepan.  Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly until it reaches a light brown.  Add 1\/4 cup cold water and stir constantly.  Once mixture reaches a low boil, reduce heat and add soymilk in a continuous stream, stirring constantly.  Gradually increase heat, all the while stirring (arms tired yet? haha).  Mixture should be thick.  If too runny, continue to heat and stir.  Once desired consistency, add vanilla and remove from heat.\nSpread the cream cheese mixture over the cookie \"crust,\" leaving a little bit of space around the edges.  Drain the apples and arrange elegantly on top of the pizza, and sprinkle with cinnamon.  I usually spend a great deal of time on this step.  (If you prepared the caramel sauce, it will cool while you arrange the apples.  If the sauce is not room temperature by the time you are finished arranging, cool it in the freezer until it is).

Sprinkle yeast on top of the water and gently stir until yeast is completely dissolved. Let the yeast mixture stand in a warm spot for about 5 minutes, until you see a foamy layer form across the top of the mixture.\n2) In a large bowl, combine flours and salt. Scoop shallow hole in the center of the flour to form a well and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. With a big wooden spoon, combine the ingredients until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.\n3) Turn dough out onto a floured board or countertop and knead for about 8 minutes.\n4) Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rest and rise for about an hour. The dough should double in bulk.\n5) When dough is finished rising, knead lightly for a couple of minutes more and cut into 2 pieces (for making 2 12-inch pizzas; if you want individual sized pizzas, cut the dough into 4 or pieces).\n6) Shape each piece into a ball. With your fingers, flatten each ball into a circle of dough about 6 inches in diameter. Use a rolling pin that has been dusted with flour to roll the dough into a 12-inch pizza crust (6-inch for individual pizzas). Your pizzas can be any shape:  round, rectangular, whatever.\n7) Dust a pizza pan with cornmeal.  Transfer pizza crust to pan.

For dough, combine water, sugar, and active dry yeast to activate yeast and let sit for at least 5 minutes.  In a mixer, add the dry ingredients and mix on a low setting using a bread hook. When the yeast is ready, add it to the mixer with the olive oil. Let the dough form in the mixer until it forms a uniform ball and starts to climb the bread hook. (If you do not have a mixer, then combine the dry ingredients with the bowl of yeast, kneed until smooth.)\n2. Remove and let stand for about 45-50 minutes or until it doubles in size. You want the crust to be more fluffy for your end product, so you should allow more time for the dough to rise. While waiting for the dough to rise, prepare the other ingredients. To prepare the sauce, add all of the ingredients in a sauce pan and let simmer on low heat until ready to use, stirring occasionally.\n3. In a lightly oiled skillet, add the seitan and lightly brown. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and then use the the cornmeal and flour to dust the counter. Form an even roll. Stretch the dough to fit a round pizza baking pan and allow some dough to hang over edges. Lightly dust with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0 F.\n4. Cut the sliceable cheese (Teese) into short 1-2\" sticks about 1\/4\" thick. Line the edge of the pizza, overlapping the cheese just slightly. Once the cheese is in place, take the extra dough hanging over the edge and fold over the cheese to seal it.  Add the the sauce followed by the mushroom, onion, pepperoni and seitan. Then add the other cheeses.\n5. Sprinkle dried basil over the cheese for a little added flavor. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until crust is a nice golden brown.

While that's warming,  dice the squash, onion and tofu, and toss them into the pan. While they're softening, wash the mushrooms, remove the stems, dice, and stir into the pan. Then stir in the tablespoon of pesto. While that's cooking, chop the parsley and then stir it in with the 2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning.

Mix thoroughly with the flour, it will be quite tacky in texture.\nUsing either a clean countertop, or a sheet of wax paper, sprinkle a tablespoon of the cornmeal, and push the dough into a small rectangular shape with your fingers. Sprinkle the other tablespoon of cornmeal on top, flip it over, and roll it out into a large rectangle shape (roughly 18\"x10\") and about 1\/4\" thick. Let that sit for a couple minutes if you bought a block of mozzarella and need to grate it.\nTake out the now-cooled filling, mix in the mozzarella and dump onto the dough. Using your hands, spread the filling, to within about 1\/2\" of the edge, and press the filling into the dough.\nStarting at one of the long sides of the rectangle, roll the dough & filling into a long log much like a sushi roll or a Yule log. Pinch the outside flap of dough into the dough so that it sticks and doesn't unroll. Using a serrated or bread knife, saw the roll into 1.5\" sections so that it looks like pizza sushi.\nPlace flat, spiral-looking side down on a non-stick or greased baking sheet so it looks like 12 cinnamon rolls. Bake for 20 minutes.\nWhile that's cooking, warm up the pizza sauce (basically tomato sauce with basil & oregano).

Chop off the end of the broccoli stalk approximately 1 cm from the end, don't cut it all off!  There's lots of good stuff in that stalk!

Personally I like to use a hot Cajun pepper sauce to add spice [this product may only be available in the UK - sorry!], but I expect Tabasco sauce would be a fine substitute.\nAlways remember to taste your chili!  If it seems to be a bit bland add a LITTLE salt [remember that more salt can be added but it can't be taken out!].
